# itschool

  This repository contains a collection of learning sessions I attended during the Java course organized by ITSchool. In addition to those sessions, you will also
find small individual projects and solved exercises, which reflect my progress in learning the Java programming language. This resource not only serves as a place
to learn and explore Java concepts but also to observe the evolution of my programming skills.

  Contributions and suggestions are always welcome! I'm open to any feedback or collaboration. If you have suggestions, improvements, or new ideas, I encourage you
to open an issue or submit a pull request.
